    <p>After 15 years of an enormously successful charity bike ride, this year will be AngelRideâ€™s Grand Finale! This will be the 11th year that the Connecticut Amateur Radio Emergency Service (CT ARES) has provided communications to support the riders.</p>
     
    <p>As an amateur radio operator who has previously supported this event or shown interest, I am inviting you to join us for the Grand Finale! We will be staffing various checkpoints along the two routes as well as the three rest stops. To participate you will need either a vehicle with a mobile radio or a GoBox based on a mobile radio. Portable/handheld analog radios will not do the job. Having DMR capability on the CT-ARES DMR Network would be a huge plus. Some loaner DMR equipment is available.</p>
